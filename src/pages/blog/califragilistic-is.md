Dont remember \
Spell e de doucious

Madness is not kindness \
Violence is not danse \
Patate is not tact \
So push me away \
Away from the tree \
La pomme from some \
Arbre \
Like a barde \
A wizard With a bird \
Meet some meat \
Eat some bite \
Dream of scream \
Love to move \
Move to love \
Do we blow \
In the flow \
When we glow ?

In the danse \
When i glance \
At your mouth \
Jolie rousse \
You so douce \
Do some mousse

Sadness is not kindness \
Honesty is not desire \
Fire is not bonheur \
And malheur is not butter \
But better is bitter \
And father my mother \
Douleur not answer \
Râleur not dancer \
Do we do \
In the mood \
When we boude

In the danse \
When i glance \
At your prune \
Jolie brune \
You so fun \
Do some run

Les couleurs \
Se mélangent \
Me dérangent \
Me vidangent \
Me démangent \
Mes phalanges \
Don’t repeat \
Suis the beat \
Follow the rabbit \
The white one \
Do we still \
In the steal \
When we vole

In the danse \
When i glance \
At your eyes \
Jolie blonde \
You so ronde \
Do some monde

And the verb \
Was the first \
And the draw \
Was the burst \
Maze was the waze \
And the Ways \
Were the waves \
Grab my grappe \
Tâte ma tarte \
You so smart \
Beautiful was hopeful \
You so cool \
Dam’ your boule \
Do some foule \
Do we do \
In the Doubs \
When we doute

In the danse \
When i glance \
At your kart \
Jolie Marthe \
You so smart \
Do some fart
